# Engineering Team

**Lead**: Himanshu Dixit

## The Setup

Two layers. Me + senior frontend lead + five engineers. That's it for now.

### Layer 1: Architecture

**Himanshu Dixit - Platform Lead**
- System architecture (the big decisions)
- Agent framework (CrewAI, LangGraph)
- Database design
- Backend patterns and code review
- Production incidents
- Mentoring backend folks

**Senior Frontend Engineer**
- Frontend architecture (Next.js, state, performance)
- Design system ownership
- Figma MCP workflows
- Component library
- Frontend code review
- Mentoring frontend folks

### Layer 2: The Builders

**Backend Engineers (2)**
- APIs - FastAPI, Pydantic, REST
- Database - SQLAlchemy, Alembic, migrations
- Agents - CrewAI/LangGraph integration
- Background jobs - Celery tasks
- Tests - pytest, coverage

**Frontend Engineers (2)**
- UI - React, TypeScript, Tailwind
- Components - Build once, use everywhere
- Prototyping - Figma MCP pipeline
- Testing - E2E, component tests

**DevOps Engineer (1)**
- CI/CD - GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure - Docker, AWS
- Monitoring - Sentry, Prometheus
- Performance - profiling, optimization

## What We Expect

### Everyone
- Ship code weekly. Doesn't have to be huge but make progress.
- Test your code. 80% coverage. No exceptions.
- Review others' code. Every PR needs eyes.
- Document decisions. Future you will thank present you.
- Ask questions. After 30 min of trying, ask. Don't spin.

### Backend
- Async patterns. Know when to use async def.
- SQLAlchemy. Relationships, eager loading, transactions.
- Agent frameworks. CrewAI for orchestration, LangGraph for state.
- API design. RESTful, versioned, documented.

### Frontend
- Next.js 14. Server Components, streaming, parallel routes.
- TypeScript strict. Types catch bugs.
- State management. React Query for server, Zustand for client.
- Performance. Bundle size, Core Web Vitals, memoization.

### DevOps
- Docker. Multi-stage builds, layer caching.
- AWS. ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, networking.
- CI/CD. Test, lint, deploy. Automated.
- Monitoring. Know what's broken before users report it.

## How We Talk

- **Google Chat** - Quick questions, daily chatter. Threads, not walls.
- **Google Drive** - RFCs, architecture docs. Version history is useful.
- **Trello** - Sprint tasks. Simple boards. Move cards.
- **GitHub** - Code. Issues. PRs.
- **Figma** - Design. Prototyping.

## Growth Path

**Month 1**: Learn the stack, ship small features  
**Month 2**: Own a feature area, contribute to architecture decisions  
**Month 3**: Lead a feature, help onboard others
